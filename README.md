Sentiment Analysis on Restaurant Reviews Dataset. 

Comparison between CNN and RNN approach.

This project was developed by:

- Esther Flores

- Candela García

- María Hernández

Dataset used: [Restaurant Customer Reviews, Kaggle] (https://www.kaggle.com/vigneshwarsofficial/reviews)

The aim of the project is to train two different Neural Networks: CNN and RNN. 

Theoretically, as the dataset is made of: text sequences (reviews) and a label whether it is a positive or negative review (1 and 0 respectively), we had a first hypothesis that RNN model would get better results, a higher accuracy.

We based our models in the models uploaded in the following repository: [PyTorch Sentiment Analysis] (https://github.com/bentrevett/pytorch-sentiment-analysis)
